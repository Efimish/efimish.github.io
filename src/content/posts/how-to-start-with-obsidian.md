[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is one of my favorite apps of all time.
I use it to take notes, journal and connect my thoughts.

Before Obsidian, I used other note-taking apps, mainly Apple Notes.
The reason I switched to Obsidian is because it is cross-platform, flexible, and uses Markdown.
And there was a lot of hype around it :)

Watching YouTube videos of other people's setups,
It felt like obsidian was really difficult and would take months to master.
But you don't have to make it that difficult - it's up to you!
Just install it and create some notes, just like in any other note-taking app.
You don't need to learn plugins, workflows, dataview queries - leave all that for later.
Only add these complications when you really need them.
This is called a gradual approach.

The idea behind Obsidian is simple - you don't need
to structure your notes in any way, you just need
to connect them - like in your brain.

The most important are the connections between notes - **links**.
Type `[[`
and insert the name of another note - the connection is now established and visible on the graph.
You can even connect to missing notes and create them later.

Then there are **folders** - the OG way of structuring data.
They strictly separate data and allow for bulk operations.

Finally, **tags** - they add keywords to notes.
This is useful for finding notes.
Unlike folders, one note can have multiple tags.

That's enough - now you can start creating your PKMS.
