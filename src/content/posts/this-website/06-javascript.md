Astro framework ships 0 JavaScript by default, which I love.
For a simple website like mine, most things donâ€™t require JavaScript at all.

But some interactions are only possible with it - like switching color themes dynamically.

## Theme switching logic

I added a `<select>` element where users can choose a theme.
Whenever they select a different option, the website should:

1. Update the colors instantly.
2. Save the choice so it persists across page reloads
(my site is a multi-page app, so state isnâ€™t preserved automatically).

Hereâ€™s the script I use:

```ts
const theme = localStorage.getItem("theme") ?? "system";
document.documentElement.dataset.theme = theme;

const selector = document.querySelector(
  "select#theme-selector"
) as HTMLSelectElement | null;

if (selector !== null) {
  selector.value = theme;

  selector.addEventListener("change", () => {
    const value = selector.value;
    localStorage.setItem("theme", value);
    document.documentElement.dataset.theme = value;
  });
}
```

- On load, it checks localStorage for a saved theme.
- The `<html>` element gets a data-theme attribute
(instead of a class, since it feels cleaner and supports multiple values).
- When the user changes the selector,
the new value is saved back to localStorage and applied immediately.

This way, the site remembers the theme until the user clears browser storage.

## Bonus: a little easter egg ðŸŒ¿

Just for fun, I added this line:

```ts
console.log("%cðŸŒ¿", "font-size: 8em");
```

Open the browser console and youâ€™ll see a giant leaf emoji printed out.
